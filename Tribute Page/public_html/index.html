               <p><strong>Ratan Naval Tata</strong>(Ratan Ṭāṭā, born 28 December 1937) is an Indian 
                   industrialist, philanthropist, and a former chairman of Tata Sons. He was also chairman 
                   of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim chairman, from October 2016 through 
                   February 2017, and continues to head its charitable trusts.[3][4] He is the recipient of two of the highest civilian 
                   awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and Padma Bhushan (2000).</p>
                            <p>Born in 1937, he is a scion of the Tata family, and son of Naval Tata who was later adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group. 
                        He is an alumnus of the Cornell University College of Architecture and Harvard Business School through the 
                        Advanced Management Program that he completed in 1975.[6] He joined his company in 1961 when he used to work 
                        on the shop floor of Tata Steel, and was the apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon the latter's retirement 
                        in 1991. He got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to 
                        acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centrist group into a global business. </p>
